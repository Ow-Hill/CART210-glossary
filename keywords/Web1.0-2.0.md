## Web 1.0/Web2.0 

The evolution of the world-wide-web (www) from static HTML pages to dynamic interactive web applications and user-generated content platforms through an “architecture of participation” [^OwenHWeb1and2point0-2] is commonly referred to as Web 2.0.  Retrospectively the previous static approach is referred to as Web 1.0.  [^OwenHWeb1and2point0-1] 

The term was popularized by Tim O’Reilly and Dale Dougherty of O’Reilly Media in preparing for a conference in October 2004.   Characteristics of Web 2.0 include: [^OwenHWeb1and2point0-1] 

-  User-generated content 

-  Interactive applications 

-  Social networking 

-  Collaboration between users 

-  Rich user experiences [^OwenHWeb1and2point0-2]

The term is not a specific ‘program’ or ‘application’ but rather signifies the profound shift in core principles of web companies, with these 7 principles being core competencies [^OwenHWeb1and2point0-1] 

-  Services, not packaged software, with cost affective scalability 

-  Control over unique, hard to recreate data sources 

-  Trusting users as co-developers 

-  Harnessing collective intelligence 

-  Leveraging variety of product over product volume through customer self service 

-  Software above level of single device 

-  Lightweight user interfaces, development models, and business models 

The shift to Web 2.0 changed how media was created, distributed and consumed [^OwenHWeb1and2point0-1]  which has been significant in the establishment of ‘new media’, an example of which is YouTube.  A web-based platform which allows ordinary users to create content and democratized the creation of content [^OwenHWeb1and2point0-3]. In distributing such content on it’s platform it also allowed participation of others in evaluating and commenting on the content in the form of ‘likes’, ‘dislikes’ (rest in peace) and ‘comments’.  Previously control of content was centralized and this new platform, including sharing economics with the creators, has upended traditional media changing the manner in which media is consumed.  Previously, media was typically consumed on set schedules, now media can be consumed on demand at any time and on any device.  

Social networking using platforms such as Twitter (now X), and Facebook have resulted in creation of citizen lead journalism, speeding up the creation of news production through personally created stories which also permit the ability for two way communication with such creators [^OwenHWeb1and2point0-4].  These platforms, which are free to use, permit advertising as a means to compensate for their creation and in turn targeted advertising is now the norm creating tailored marketing campaigns.
