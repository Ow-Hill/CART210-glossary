## Wiki 

Wiki is a term used to refer to collaborative creation of knowledge and has generally been a reference to online or web-based information sources. The concept of the Wiki is based on anyone being able to edit or add pages with minimal difficulty [^OwenHWiki1], doing this through designing the database to be as simple as possible. The most common example is ‘Wikipedia’ which is an online open encyclopedia which relies on users to create, edit and moderate content, and aims to integrate and display encyclopedic knowledge from the ground up [^OwenHWiki1].  Today the term ‘Wiki’ refers to a knowledge source which has been created through open collaboration.   

The term was created by Ward Cunningham in 1995 [^OwenHWiki1]. A computer engineer, he pioneered the ability to allow users to add free form data to a database and link it to other sources – a quick and easy collaborative editing process. Cunningham designed this with the goal of making “a relatively simple software that would enable collective work on software codes that could be published immediately” [^OwenHWiki1]. Cunningham implemented this through web pages and called it WikiWikiWeb; with Wiki Wiki meaning quickly / hurry in Hawaiian.  

Despite wikis being “Free spray cans next to a concrete wall” [^OwenHWiki1] they work very well, in part due to the ‘wiki philosophy’ that often surrounds them, perhaps best demonstrated by many wikis being registered as free software under a GNU general public license (GPL) [^OwenHWiki1]. This prevents the wiki from being privatized for commercial use, as well as ensuring free use, distribution, and editing for Wikis. The wiki philosophy also shapes around the use for wikis within communities, with them providing “a mechanism for large populations to rapidly share content, organize information and generate group consensus” [^OwenHWiki2], allowing artists and creators to start into new media by facilitating a database of user experiences and expertise. [^OwenHWiki2]  

The term is significant in today’s digital landscape for several reasons.  First, it signifies the collaborative nature of knowledge creation, rather than a single source or point of view. Second, traditional knowledge was maintained by ‘gatekeepers’ who curated content, today wiki’s help with diverse inputs and representation of many individuals/groups [^OwenHWiki2] by making them as simple as possible [^OwenHWiki1] and ensuring the bar of entry to be able to contribute and use wikis is at a minimum [^OwenHWiki1]. Third, this open approach speeds up the creation of content making the result more relevant. However, despite openness being the source of the wiki's strength [^OwenHWiki1] it also comes with some challenges, primarily the potential for manipulation, i.e. an individual could change the content with an intent to mislead others 

It has also evolved current practices by promoting open-source software development [^OwenHWiki1], for example GitHub applies these collaborative principles to code development.  Tools such as Confluence promote wiki principles of collaborative editing and knowledge organization [^OwenHWiki2].  Indeed, today many tools today, including Google Docs and Microsoft, promote a more collaborative approach to document creation, allowing multiple users to edit a document at once.
